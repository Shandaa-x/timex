### Firebase Data Structure Fixed:

The payment service now properly saves:
```json
{
  "foodCount": 4,
  "foodDetails": [
    {
      "id": "food_001",
      "name": "Burger", 
      "price": 15000,
      "image": "base64string",
      "date": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "paidAmount": 15000,
      "remainingBalance": 0
    }
  ],
  "paymentDistribution": {
    "food_001": 15000,
    "food_002": 5000
  },
  "totalFoodAmount": 48000,
  "remainingBalance": 28000,
  "status": "partial"
}
```

### Sample Data:

The UI now shows realistic sample data:
- üçî **Classic Beef Burger**: ‚ÇÆ15,000 - FULLY PAID
- üçï **Margherita Pizza**: ‚ÇÆ25,000 - PARTIALLY PAID (‚ÇÆ10,000 paid, ‚ÇÆ15,000 remaining)
- ü•ó **Caesar Salad**: ‚ÇÆ8,000 - UNPAID
- üç∞ **Chocolate Cake**: ‚ÇÆ6,000 - PARTIALLY PAID (‚ÇÆ3,000 paid, ‚ÇÆ3,000 remaining)
- üßÉ **Fresh Orange Juice**: ‚ÇÆ4,000 - FULLY PAID

### User Experience:

1. **Payment History Tab** now shows individual food items instead of generic payment cards
2. **Each food item** clearly displays:
   - Unique food ID
   - Payment status with color coding
   - Amount paid vs remaining balance
   - Payment progress bar
   - Individual payment transaction history
3. **Visual indicators** make it easy to see which foods need payment
4. **Sample data** automatically loads if no data exists
