# Food Payment Tracking Implementation ✅ UPDATED

## Solution Overview

I've updated the implementation to track **meals that were eaten but not yet paid for**. This addresses the real business need:

1. **Track payment status** rather than eaten status ✅
2. **Payment calculation based on unpaid meals** ✅
3. **Filter to show only unpaid meals** ✅

## Updated Features ✅

### 1. Enhanced Payment Tracking
- ✅ `_paidMeals` map tracks which individual meals are paid for (key: dateKey-foodIndex)
- ✅ Only meals that were eaten are tracked for payment
- ✅ Payment status is stored per meal, not per day

### 2. Updated Food Report Screen
- ✅ **Focus on unpaid meals**: Shows only meals that need to be paid for
- ✅ **"Төлөх" (Pay) buttons** for each unpaid meal
- ✅ **Visual indicators**: Orange/warning colors for unpaid, green for paid
- ✅ **Empty state**: Shows celebration when all meals are paid

### 3. Updated Summary Cards
- ✅ **Unpaid meals count**: Shows number of unpaid meals
- ✅ **Unpaid amount**: Total amount owed for unpaid meals
- ✅ **Paid amount**: Total amount already paid for meals
- ✅ **Payment balance**: Shows if credit/debit balance exists

### 4. Updated Daily Breakdown Section
- ✅ **Only shows unpaid meals** with payment buttons
- ✅ **Day totals**: Shows unpaid amount per day
- ✅ **Easy payment**: One-click payment for each meal
- ✅ **Success feedback**: Shows when meals are marked as paid

## How It Works

**Daily Workflow**:
1. Employee comes to work and presses "ИРЛЭЭ"
2. Food is recorded during the day (as before)
3. Employee marks if food was eaten (existing functionality)
4. **NEW**: Employee or admin pays for eaten meals:
   - Press "Төлөх" (Pay) button for each meal 💳
   - Meal moves from unpaid to paid status

**Payment Logic**:
- ✅ Only eaten meals can be paid for
- ✅ Unpaid meals show in the report with payment buttons
- ✅ Paid meals are excluded from unpaid calculations
- ❌ Uneaten meals are not shown in payment reports
